// Comparison operator related problems!

// 1. Choose the correct comparison operator to alert true, when x is greater than y.

let x = 10;
let y = 5;

alert( x > y);



// 2. Choose the correct conditional (ternary) operator to alert "Too young" if age is less than 18, otherwise alert "Old enough".

let age = 21;

alert(age > 18 ? "Too young" : "Old enough");
